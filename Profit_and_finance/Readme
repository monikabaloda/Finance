I upload the following files: 
  1. Main report : this is the final document containing the hypothsis formation to results and then inferences. I disuss methodology in detail in this document. 
  2. Code : I submit a R-markdown file which contains the code blocks and their description along with. 
  3. Data : due to the limited size github allow, I cannot upload the data here. However, I can provide it to you if needed.
