Financial market volatility is an important input for investment, option pricing, and financial market
regulation and there is no ambiguity in saying that technology is the engine of growth. In this project,
I investigate the co-movement of technology and non-technology sectors for the last seventeen years.
Calling the close co-movement ‘coupling’, I show that after the year 2015, the technology and non-
technology sectors decouples in terms of their levels and volatility. I argue that covid-19 shock is
not the reason behind this decoupling phenomenon. In addition to this, I show that the technology
sector is a leading indicator of growth for the rest of the economy. I use ARIMA modeling and
stationarity tests to process our time series for analysis and testing. We find that the technology
sector index follows ARIMA(3,1,3), while the non-technology sector follows ARIMA(2,1,4) model. I
discuss the steps of data wrangling, pre-processing, missing value treatment, and exploratory data
analysis (EDA). I discuss the merits and shortcomings of my work wherever required to correctly
interpret my results
